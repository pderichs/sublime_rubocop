# Sublime RuboCop

A [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin that runs [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) on your Ruby files in the editor. It will mark issues right inside the view but it can also be called as a "compiler" from the ST menu.

The Plugin currently supports both ST2 and ST3, but the usage of ST3 is strongly recommended.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please make sure `rubocop` is installed:

`gem install rubocop`

### Recommended:

Install Sublime RuboCop via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

### Manual:

1. Navigate to the Sublime Text Packages folder (You can find the location of the Packages folder [here](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/basic_concepts.html#the-data-directory)).

2. Run the git clone command right inside the packages directory: `git clone git@github.com:pderichs/sublime_rubocop.git "RuboCop"`

3. Restart Sublime Text.

## What can it do for you?

By default, the plugin marks RuboCop issues right in the view when you open or save a Ruby file.

Additionally you can run RuboCop from the ST menu in many ways. For example you can perform a RuboCop check on all files of the current project to get a general overview. The issues will be listed inside the Sublime output window, so you can easily navigate to each of them.

You can also run the RuboCop auto correction for the current file from the Sublime Text menu.

## Key Bindings
Add to `Preferences -> Key Bindings`:
```
[
  { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+c"], "command": "rubocop_check_single_file" },
  { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+c"], "command": "rubocop_check_project" },
  { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+v"], "command": "rubocop_check_file_folder" }
]
```

### ST2

Due to performance issues the plugin behaves a bit different under ST2. It will run RuboCop only when you **save** files. If you experience any performance issues when saving ruby files caused by that plugin, just disable the functionality in the settings (see ```mark_issues_in_view```).

## Environment

By default this plugin uses [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to run RuboCop, but you can switch to [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or provide your own command line in the settings. The plugin uses default paths to run rvm or rbenv but you can customize these paths in the settings.

## ToDo

* As reported by some users the plugin seems to be not working properly when using RVM with custom gemsets: [issue #19](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop/issues/19).

## Reporting issues

If you encounter an issue, please add some general information about your environment:

* Operating System
* Sublime Text version
* Details about your config e.g. do you use `rbenv`, `rvm` or `your_own_command` to run rubocop?

Please also provide the steps to reproduce the issue.
