# Sublime RuboCop

A Sublime Text plugin that runs a [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) check on the current file or the current project. By default it uses [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to run RuboCop, but you can switch to [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or provide your own command line in the settings.

Enjoy!

## Installation

Preferred way:

Install Sublime RuboCop via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

Alternative way:

1. Navigate to the Sublime Text Packages folder (on Mac OS X it can be found here: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`, if you use another OS you can find the location of the Packages folder [here](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/basic_concepts.html#the-data-directory))

2. Run the git clone command right inside the packages directory: `git clone git@github.com:pderichs/sublime_rubocop.git "RuboCop"`

3. Restart Sublime Text.
